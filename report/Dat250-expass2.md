For this task I used bruno for the manual tests and jUnit for the automated tests.

For this task I found it most challenging to understand where to stop and what the task asked for. I believed the project to be much harder than it was and used a good amount of time to peel away all the unnecessary parts. 

I found it hard to understand how I was going to do the automated tests. I tried for a long time to make bruno work in vscode but was unfortunately unsuccessful. I had also created jUnit tests in java, but only for the methods and not for the endpoints. It took some time to understand what I needed for the tests to do what I wanted them to do, and to figure out the best way to implement it and I am still a little unsure if I did it the correct way.
